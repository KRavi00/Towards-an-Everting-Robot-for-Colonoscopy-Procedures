# Towards-an-Everting-Robot-for-Colonoscopy-Procedures
This repository contains all the relevant code and files for the associated Master's project.

The following is included in this repository:
- DC motor control code (for use with an L293D module)
  - Allows robot growth speed and direction control. It is a modified version of the Pre-formed Vine Robot control code [found here](https://www.vinerobots.org/build-one/pre-formed-vine-robot/).

- Pressure sensor conversion code (for use with the SMC PSE543A-R06 sensor)
  - Converts analogue output of sensor into kPa pressure readings.

- CAD files of 3D printed parts used
  - The motor mount and spool are also modified versions of the part files [found here](https://www.vinerobots.org/build-one/pre-formed-vine-robot/).
  - The prototype assembly used to create the renders from the report are also included.
